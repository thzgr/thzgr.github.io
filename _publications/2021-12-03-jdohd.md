In the last decades, obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have become increasingly prevalent in wide world. Fatty liver can be detrimental to liver regeneration (LR) and offspring of obese dams (HFD-O) are susceptible to NAFLD development. Here we evaluated LR capacity in HFD-O after partial hepatectomy (PHx). HFD-O re-exposed or not to HFD in later life were evaluated for metabolic parameters, inflammation, proliferation, tissue repair markers and survival rate after PHx. Increasing adiposity and fatty liver were observed in HFD-O. Despite lower IL-6 levels, Ki67 labeling, cells in S phase and Ciclin D1/PCNA protein content, a lower impact on survival rate was found after PHx, even when re-exposed to HFD. However, no difference was observed between offspring of control dams (SC-O) and HFD-O after surgery. Although LR impairment is dependent of steatosis development, offspring of obese dams are programmed to be protected from the damage promoted by HFD.
