My desktop computer is a Ryzen 5 1600 without overclock, 16GB RAM, Kingston 500GB SSD and a Asus RX 580 4GB

Also my laptop has a Ryzen 5 5500U, 20GB RAM, 256GB NVMe + 500GB SSD and Integrated AMD Radeon

I'm trying to find a way to maintain a (little) home server to self host some software that I like. I love to play with hardware shit. If I start running a home server I'll be making a blog post about it.
