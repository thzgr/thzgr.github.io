This is not something to be proud of but well here we are.<br>

Some topics I'm interested in:<br>
- Data Engineering, Spark, Data pipelines<br>
- Python<br>
- Cloud computing <br>
- Databases (mostly PostgreSQL) <br>
- Bioinformatics<br>
- Transcriptomics<br>
- Liver disease<br>
- Statistics<br>
- Linux & FOSS<br>
- Hardware<br>
- And bicycles.

Let's see what else
=====
Be kind, help someone, learn how to live, don't live to work.<br>
Stop comparing yourself to others, they don't live your life.<br>
No racism, no homophobia, no transphobia, no fascism and more.
