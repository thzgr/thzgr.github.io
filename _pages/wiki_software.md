Been using Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS with a custom bash prompt which has integrations with both conda Python environment and git repos and Cosmic's tiling window, and also Windows 10 sometimes (almost never).

My Linux machine is customized disabling Gnome's top bar and using Polybar and rofi following [these dotfiles](https://github.com/thzgr/dotfiles).

As text editor I've been using [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) for quick changes and when I'm tired of a GUI, and also VSCodium (fully FOSS version of Microsoft's VSCode).

Firefox as my main browser but currently migrating to Brave.

For note taking and notebook keeping I use Joplin. I've used Notion before but Joplin fits my needs nowadays!

Other two softwares I recommend is Bitwarden and Aegis.
