Been using Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS with a custom bash prompt which has integrations with both conda Python environment and git repos and Cosmic's tiling window, and also Windows 10 sometimes (almost never).

Currently using the Dracule theme on Gnome shell and an extension called Window List that creates a small lower bar to show currently opened windows in a nice way following [these dotfiles](https://github.com/thzgr/dotfiles).

As text editor I've been using [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) for quick changes and when I'm tired of a GUI, and also VSCodium (fully FOSS version of Microsoft's VSCode).

Firefox as my main browser but using Brave/Ungoogled Chromium when needed.

For note taking and notebook keeping I use Notesnook ~~Joplin~~. I've used Joplin ~~Notion~~ before but Notesnook fits my needs nowadays!

Other two softwares I recommend is Bitwarden and Aegis.
